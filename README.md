# WOLF3D

Welcome to WOLF3D

For this project I had to create a 3D graphical representation of a maze from a subjective view.
To create this represemtation I learnt about the Ray-Casting principles.
The result is the following.

How run to WOLF3D

1) Go to the following link and install minilbx (This is a graphics library that students in France created for the school). -    https://github.com/abouvier/minilibx.git
2) After installation, open your terminal and cd into the "wolf3d" root directory.
3) Now to compile the code, enter in "make / make re" into your command line.
4) To execute the program enter in the following in the command line "./wolf3d map0.txt"
5) The virtual wolrd should now appear on your screen. Use the directional keys for movement. Bare in that I did not 
   implement long-key-hooks, so tapping is essential for continuous movement.
6) Press "esc" to exit the program.

Disclaimer
The libft is not mine.
I have only tested this on apple devices.
